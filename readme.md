# nanocom

[Picocom](https://linux.die.net/man/8/picocom) but cross platform. 

This is a small project I have setup as I really like Picocom but alas I sometimes need to use Windows; I chose Rust's extensive package ecosystem has several packages for handling serial port operations to be cross platform, allowing for greater ease of development.
